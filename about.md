  Hi, I’m Anhad. If you’re having a hard time pronouncing my name, consider the sentence, “An engineer had to build it”. Combine “an” and “had” and that’s my name. <br /><br />

  I studied materials engineering at University of British Columbia where I studied about steel, samurai swords and some other things. After graduating in 2017, I took a turn and spent time getting better at the art of programming. 
 <br /><br />
  I am now working as a junior software developer at <a href="https://www.frogplum.com/">Frogplum Solutions</a> - a startup hoping to do big things. Particularly, I am in charge of one of their projects, focussing on performance on the back-end development and API design. We are building an online calculator for people who wish to immigrate to Canada to assess their eligibility, suggest suitable programs and connect them to lawyers, a project projected to help build remote cities in Canada (that counts as big).
  <br /><br />

  When I am not coding, I spend my time drinking copious amounts of tea or getting bruised from my amateur skateboarding drills.
