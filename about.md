  Hi, I’m Anhad. If you’re having a hard time pronouncing my name, consider the sentence, “An engineer had to build it”. Combine “an” and “had” and that’s my name. <br /><br />

  I studied materials engineering at University of British Columbia where I studied about steel, samurai swords and some other things. After graduating in 2017, I took a turn and taught myself programming. 
 <br /><br />

  When I am not coding, I spend my time drinking copious amounts of tea or getting bruised from my amateur skateboarding drills.
