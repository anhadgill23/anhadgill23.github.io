<p class="post">

  Hi, I’m Anhad. If you’re having a hard time pronouncing my name, consider the sentence, “An engineer had to build it”. Combine “an” and “had” and that’s my name. <br /><br />

I am a science and technology enthusiast. My academic background is in engineering and my interest in technology made me take a turn after graduation and teach myself coding. Now, I am eager to provide value in the field of tech, particularly web development, using my newly acquired skillset. <br /><br />

When I am not coding, I spend my time drinking copious amounts of tea or getting bruised from my amateur skateboarding drills.
